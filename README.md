# RC_Car

Building an Arduino powered RC car. Mostly just trying to keep track of files for myself but feel free to use any of this. CAD is done in Solidworks/Onshape (free option). Code could be a useful reference for PWM control/radio communication.

##### DRV8871 H-Bridge Controller (1)
##### NRF24L01 Radio (2)
